This package may not compile with older versions of gcc. Version 3.3
or later is highly recommended. This is especially true on OS X.

To generate a nice printable manual, issue the command `make pdf'.

This package is no longer being actively developed, as I've switched
to C++ for all non-trivial systems software development. All
forseeable future releases of cbase will be for bugfixes only. If you
are interested in taking ownership of this package and developing it
further, please contact me by leaving me feedback at
